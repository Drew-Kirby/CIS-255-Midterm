                    <p>
                        I'm a second-year Computer Information Systems major at Saginaw Valley State University. I am
                        currently working as Front Desk Staff at the Office of Student
                        Life at SVSU. It's a role that keeps me on my toes and lets me put my problem-solving skills to
                        good use and also gives me an opportunity to meet new people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before my current position, I had roles at previous jobs such as Slingerland Auto Sales,
                        Culver's, and Subway.
                        Each experience has taught me something valuable about teamwork, customer service, and the art
                        of balancing multiple responsibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So far in my time at SVSU, I have learned about different programming languages such as Java and
                        VisualBasic.NET. I am looking forward to learning more about other topics in
                        the future, such as, for example, web application development. I'm a bit of a tech enthusiast
                        and
                        I like learning about the future of technology and I want to be a part of it. It is an exciting
                        journey that constantly challenges me to think differently and find new ways to solve problems
                        every day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of the classroom, I believe in giving back to my community. I've been a part of the
                        National Honor Society in my time at Corunna High School, and I am a proud Robert and Ellen
                        Thompson Scholar.
                        It is a rewarding experience that gives me a sense of accomplishment when I realize how
                        volunteering and helping others can make a difference.
                    </p>
